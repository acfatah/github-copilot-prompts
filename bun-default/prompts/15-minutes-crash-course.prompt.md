For a give topic, create a 15-minute crash course on the topic given for full-stack
developers. Structure the content as concise, actionable bullet points. Use markdown
formatting. Use tables where helpful. Focus on factual accuracy and organize each
section using the What, Why, and How framework. Prioritize core concepts that deliver
immediate practical value. Use fenced block for code snippets and commands. Include
tips and common pitfalls; something that need to be aware of. Prefer TypeScript.
Use `bun` for package management and runtime. Outline other topics that are related
at the end to further the study.
